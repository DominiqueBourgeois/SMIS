**** SMIS/Linux from ESRF Slurm ****
How to create a new version of SMIS ?
=> transferred the SMIS version to ESRF account /home/esrf/bourgeoi/SMIS using WinSCP
=> login to ESRF via Slurm
=> cd /home/esrf/bourgeoi/SMIS/SMIS_vsnX.Y
=> change names in the STANDALONE directory for readability
=> run Matlab2021b
=> create the Linux executable with the Matlab Application compiler, load the SMIS_X.Y_Linux_2021b.prj 
=> change names, including in "Settings" to assign proper output directories, and reload all the dependent SMIS directories (SCRIPTS etc ...)
=> Run the packaging
=> (this will crash at some point, but the correct executable is still available in the "for_testing" output directory)
=> copy the content of the "SMIS_2.2_LINUX_2021b/for_testing" directory into the DISTRIBUTE/LINUX directory
=> chmod 777 SMIS
=> chmod 777 run_SMIS.sh
=> go to this directory and type:  ./run_SMIS.sh /mnt/multipath-shares/sware/com/matlab_2021b
=> check that SMIS is working properly !
=> transfer back the SMIS version to IBS PC using WinSCP

Detected that PCT does not work well in 3D mode. Very strange ... 
Reason is huge size of sm_par.w_pattern in 3D = broadcast variable ! Should be removed !!!
So, I introduced sm_pattern_indices as an independent variable. 
+ Fix problem with textured background images.
